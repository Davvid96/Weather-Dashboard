# Module 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard Challenge

## The Task:

I have been tasked with creating a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

I had to use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.Where I had to register to receive my API key, which I used to create the function.

I had to use `localStorage` to store persistent data.

## The User Story:

```text
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## The Acceptance Criteria

- Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  - When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  - When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    - The city name
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
    - The wind speed
  - When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
  - When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Example:

The following image shows an example of the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Final Product:

The following screenshot shows the final design and look the the completed App:

App allows the user to search for a city, and then they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

- User is presented with:
  The city name, The date, An icon representation of weather conditions, The temperature, The humidity and The wind speed.

- As well as a 5-day forecast that displays:
  The date, An icon representation of weather conditions, The temperature, The humidity.

- Finally, the searched cities are saved to local storage and displayed on page, where the user can click and search for these again if they wish to do so, being presented with current and future conditions for that city.

## Conclusion:

This was a very fun challenge to work on, I think the result is good, hopefully matching most of the criteria.This was a hard but fun and educational activity, which naturally boosted my skills as well as confidence. Which will hopefully come useful in the future challenges to come. It had also shown that there is still a lot to learn, which I am eager to do.
